- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @M-rog
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently an engineer with a mechanical background learning full-stack web development through online coursework, with an emphasis on front-end. 


<!-- - ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m looking to fully pivot my career into the software engineering world, which I have developed a passion for and truly enjoy putting the puzzle pieces of code together.--> 


<!-- - ðŸ“« I'm open to any helpful advice you may have to assist in learning to code or navigate this path. Feel free to message me! Have a good day and thank you for your time. -->
